# SecuritySite
This is the code for www.voltic.tech.

Currently the website connects to a remote PostgreSQL server which is hosted on a private network.

The site is a sample design of how alarm monitoring companies could create a system to allow their customers simple and intuitive control over their alarm security plans.

The project uses c# in the form of Asp.Net Core, Entity Framework Core for database control, css, html, and js.
