        <p class="paragraph-text">
            A DIY alarm system allows users to remotely monitor their alarm security systems through their smart phones & computers.
            <br />
            <br />
            The main difference between silver and gold monitoring is the smart home features that are activated. Many locations do not need smart home capabilities but we like to offer it to those who prefer to have such devices.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Gold plan for alarm systems allow for many smart home features and devices to be implemented on your alarm system. Things such as smart locks, smart thermostats, and z-wave devices.
            <br />
            <br />
            DIY systems are perfect for those who are worried about false alarms causing police to be dispatched. A DIY account allows you as the user to make sure that an alarm is not caused by a burgalar; in the event that it is a true emergency,
            you are able to call emergency services as needed. A DIY system is also great start to test your system. Using your alarm system as a DIY for the first couple of months allows for all personel time to learn about the system.
            <br />
            Our monitoring services allows for an easy transition between professional and diy monitoring.
            <br />
            <br />
            DIY alarm systems however cannot be given an alarm monitoring certificate to your insurance company, in the event that one is needed you can transfer to professional monitoring with our 5 Diamond rated and UL certified central station.
