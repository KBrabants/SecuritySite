        <p class="paragraph-text">
            A professionally monitored alarm system is connected to our central monitoring station; this means that your alarm system is being watched 24 hours a day in the event of an alarm.
            <br />
            <br />
            The main difference between silver and gold monitoring is the smart home features that are activated. Many locations do not need smart home capabilities but we like to offer it to those who prefer to have such devices.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Gold plan for alarm systems allow for many smart home features and devices to be implemented on your alarm system. Things such as smart locks, smart thermostats, and z-wave devices.
            <br />
            <br />
            Professionally monitored systems have many benefits, primarily being the reduced cost of insurance. While some insurance companies require the owner to have an alarm system installed, many still offer  a reduced cost on their
            monthly insurance bill.
            <br />
            <br />
            Home alarm systems can also bring the owner peace of mind, not only for intrusion alert but also life safety. Almost all alarm systems can be connected a device that can detect fires such as a smoke detector and heat detectors. While it is
            not limited to those two types of devices, they can be life saving equipment that can alert the owner of a fire in the.
            <br />
            In the event that you would like to move to a DIY plan, uur monitoring services allows for an easy transition between professional and diy monitoring.
